Please click the deployed link to take the quiz: https://genius-pending.github.io/FullStackMasterMindQuiz/
This was my first attempt at implementing my own created HTML,CSS and Javascript file together it was challanging and fun at the same time it allowed me to use my own imagination
and designs to create a brilliant looking quiz that will be used for people who are learning to code as a fun quiz for them to see if they have grasped what they have learnt.
Now that I have the basic quiz I can add more or even harder question at a later date. So you will see a lot more commits on this quiz.
If anyone wants to add any more questions to it then please do saves me a job loll. Just dont mess up my code I spent a few hours trying to get this together also have a play about with it take the quiz.
